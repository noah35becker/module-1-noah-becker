************************************************************************

This code completes the weekly challenge for Module #1 in Columbia's Coding Bootcamp.

Starter code (initially downloaded [here](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram)) has been modified with accessibility in mind.

Edits include:
- Visually reorganizing + adding proper commenting for HTML and CSS
- Ensuring that HTML and CSS follow customary semantics
- Removing redundancy from CSS (and, in tandem, slightly retouching HTML where needed)
- Repairing page links
- Changing page title
- Adding "alt" attributes to images

Good Git commit practices were observed throughout.
